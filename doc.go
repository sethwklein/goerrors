// Package errors provides things for working with single and multiple errors.
//
// This package has been deprecated. Please use sethwklein.net/go/errutil
// instead. It provides the same features, but without the duplication of
// the standard errors package.
//
// It is a drop in replacement for the standard errors package
// but with extra features for handling multiple errors
// and correctly handling errors from deferred calls.
